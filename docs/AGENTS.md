## Model Compatibility Authority

The longitudinal OpenAI-compatible flow, canonical task ownership boundaries, and public response normalization MUST use `crynux-bridge/docs/model-compatibility/` in the standalone Bridge repository as their authority.

Prompt rendering, chat templates, processor behavior, tools and tool history inside model input, thinking template controls, AutoClass, remote `auto_map`, execution backends, generation, and raw decoding MUST use `gpt-task/docs/model-compatibility/` in the standalone gpt-task repository as their authority.

Relay documentation MUST retain Relay-owned validation, persistence, scheduling, transport, and task lifecycle protocols. It MUST NOT duplicate or redefine Bridge API adaptation or gpt-task execution facts. Model pages MUST NOT be implemented as Relay runtime model-ID allowlists.

## Doc Update Requirements

When updating documentation files:

1. Read the entire document first to understand its structure, sections, and flow
2. Find the most appropriate location to integrate new content based on:
   - Logical relationship with existing sections
   - Document flow and narrative
   - Where readers would naturally expect to find the information
3. Integrate new content naturally into existing sections when possible:
   - Add as a paragraph within a relevant section
   - Extend an existing list or table
   - Add as a subsection under an appropriate parent section
   - Distribute across multiple sections if a feature affects different parts of the document
4. Do NOT simply create a new top-level section and place all new content there
5. Only create a new section if the topic is truly distinct from all existing content

Write documentation as a specification.

Documentation MUST state clear, final decisions and requirements.

Documentation MUST NOT include:
- Recommendations or advice.
- Options or alternatives.
- Speculation or uncertainty.
- Future-facing placeholders.

Documentation MUST use definitive language that can be implemented and tested:
- Requirement keywords: MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHOULD. Use SHOULD only when a requirement level is intended.
- Exact behavior, constraints, and interfaces.

## Architecture Terminology Requirements

Documentation MUST follow [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for system boundary and terminology.

Crynux Relay is one off-chain Relay service that works with multiple configured blockchain networks. Documentation MUST NOT describe this as multiple Relay networks.

The term `network` in blockchain-facing features MUST mean blockchain network unless the document explicitly defines another scope. Documentation MUST use `blockchain network` or `node current blockchain network` when precision is required.

Documentation MUST NOT use `Relay network`, `current Relay network`, `node Relay network`, or `task network` to mean a blockchain network. Tasks are scheduled and dispatched by Relay and are not partitioned by blockchain network.

## Chat Content Isolation

Documentation MUST be generated from task requirements and authoritative project sources only.
User chat instructions about removing content are editing actions, not document content.
The final document MUST NOT restate removal instructions.
If a content type is removed, it must be absent from the final document.

Example chat cycle:
- AI draft includes setup commands.
- User says remove setup commands and keep only flow.
- Wrong final doc line: This document does not include setup commands.
- Right final doc line: Run the flow in order: prepare environment, start services, execute deposit and withdraw, then verify results.
